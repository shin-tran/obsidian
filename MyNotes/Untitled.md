- My hometown is Ba Ria - Vung Tau. I have been living in Ho Chi Minh for 2 years now. There are too many differences between my hometown and Ho Chi Minh city. My hometown is quite peaceful and has fresh air but Ho Chi Minh city is so noisy and has a lot of traffic jams. Ho Chi Minh has more people than my hometown. The population of my hometown is about 1 million. Ho Chi Minh is bigger than my hometown, my hometown is about 1,980 square kilometres. Ho Chi Minh has more public transport than my hometown. Ho Chi Minh has more traffic jams than my hometown. The traffic jams in Ho Chi Minh city often last a long time and are very noisy and dusty. I think my hometown has less pollution than Ho Chi Minh city. Although Ho Chi Minh is more beautiful, I prefer living in my hometown to living in Ho Chi Minh city.
